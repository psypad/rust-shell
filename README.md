# A modern shell in rust

Creating a shell in rust to learn about how shell commands are implemented, to implement similar shells in future OS/kernel projects I might take on and learn a bit on implementing compiler concepts.

## todo
- implement external commands
- complete implementations of builtins
- implement tests
- implement grammar for parsing
